## Application Modes
you can either supply your own data for analysis. This will start the application with step 1.  
you can alternatively use the data from our publication, which is preprocessed for data-safety reasons and will thus start from step 5 (Typing Filter)  
The following sections describe each step of the application in detail.



# Part 1
Supplying and filtering of raw data and calculation of distance matrices.   
This is necessary if you supply you own data.  

## 1. Source Data 
please use tab-separated-values (tsv) with the following structure

### 1.1. Typing Data
| sequenceID  | patientID  | sampleDate | allele 1 | allele 2 | allele 3 | allele 4 | ... |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --- |
| sequence 1  | patient 1  | 2022-07-03 | 47       | ?        | 78       | 65       | ... |
| sequence 2  | patient 2  | 2022-07-05 | 32       | 41       | 15       | 17       | ... |
| sequence 3  | patient 2  | 2022-07-05 | 32       | ?        | ?        | 17       | ... |
| ...         | ...        | ...        | ...      | ...      | ...      | ...      | ... |


### 1.2. Location Data
| locationID | patientID | from | till | clinic | ward | room |
| ---------- | --------- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ---- |  
| location1  | patient1  | 2022-05-02 | 2022-06-14 | Dermatology | Ward B | Room 23 |
| location2  | patient1  | 2022-06-14 | 2022-07-23 | Dermatology | Ward C | Room 12 |
| ...        | ...       | ...        | ...        | ...         | ...    | ...     |




## 2. Source Filter
The following filters can be applied to the source - data 

### 2.1. Date-Filter
all typing-data and location-data outside the range of "from" and "till" values will be removed from the data-set

### 2.2. Row-Filter
filter out rows that have less than a given percentage of correctly decoded alleles.  
in the typing-data-example above (1.1), "sequence 3" has only 50% correctly decoded alleles, 
it would be filtered out by a "row = 51%" setting or above.

### 2.3. Column-Filter
filter out columns that have less than a given percentage of correctly decoded alleles.  
in the typing-data-example above (1.1), "allele 2" as only 33% correctly decoded values, "column = 34%" would remove that column from further processing


### 2.4. Location-Filter
Some location-records might be incomplete, missing ward, room or date-values. Those records can be removed to reach a higher-quality data-set




## 3. Calculate Typing Distance Matrix
All pairs of typing data will be compared to each other for number of different alleles and the result will be stored in a distance-matrix of size n * (n-1) / 2. A sample-date-distance distance matrix of the same size is also calculated to allow for filtering in a later step (5.)

### 3.1. Count Unknown
if "null"-values are set to "count", sequence 2 and 3 in the example above (1.1) will result in a distance of 2.
if "null-values are set to *not* "count", sequence 2 and 3 in the example above (1.1) will result in a distance of 0.




## 4. Calculate Location Distance Matrix
All pairs of location data will be compared to each other for spacial and temporal distance and the result will be stored in two distance-matrices, each of size n * (n-1) / 2.  
There are no adjustable parameters for this step


# Part 2
Filtering typing and location distance matrices by the parameters described in our publication and correlating the filtered matrices to derive transmission thresholds.  
if you use the preprocessed data from our publication, the web-application starts here.


## 5. Typing Filter
The typing-distance-matrix can be filtered by distance of sample-dates. This parameter is called
"Typing Temporal" (TT) and is set to the upper limit of days between any two samples.
A histogram showing the distribution of typing distances is also created during this step. 


## 6. Location Filter
The location-distance-matrix can be filtered spacially and temporally. The "Contact Spacial" (CS) parameter allows filtering of the level of contact (clinic, ward, room or any). The "Contact Temporal" (CT) parameter allows filtering by time of stay between any two patients; negative numbers can be used for distance between non-overlapping stays.


## 7. Correlation
Correlation between cgMLST-typing-matrix and contact-matrix happens in this step. You have three parameters to adjust the outcome.   
Typing-Distance (TD) sets the upper limit for calculation and thus also the "width" of the chart. Higher values will obviously lead to longer calculation times.  
Contact-Depth (CD) sets the amount of allowed intermediary contacts. Calculation of second and third-degree connections will obviously also lead to longer calculation times.  
Mutation-Rate (MR) sets the upper limit of allowed deviation from the currently calculated typing-distance. e.g: Patients A & B with TypingDistance=3. MutationRate=2 allows for PatientLink of "A-X-B" to have "A-X" and "X-B" distance of up to 5. This is used for indirect contacts only




## Overview Of All Available Parameters 
TT ‚Äì Typing Temporal window (default: 365 days)  
CS ‚Äì Contact Spatial granularity (room, ward, clinic)  
CT ‚Äì Contact Temporal gap (e.g., -3 days)  
CD ‚Äì Contact Depth (0 = direct contacts only)  
MR ‚Äì Mutation Rate for intermediary contacts
