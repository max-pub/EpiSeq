<!-- <h1>Data Preparation</h1> -->

<p>
    The preparation module expects two TSV inputs: a typing table (allelic profiles or equivalent characteristics)
    and a location table (patient stays with from/till dates and clinic/ward/room fields).
</p>

<h2>1. Filtering</h2>

<p>
    To ensure data quality, rows or columns with too many missing/undecoded values are removed (default row filter
    90%).
    An optional column filter can be applied to exclude rarely decoded alleles from the correlation (default 0%, i.e.,
    no filtering).
    Records without required location fields (clinic/ward/room, depending on the selected filters) are
    excluded.

</p>

<h2>2. Pseudonymization</h2>

<p>
    For privacy protection, patient IDs and location names are pseudonymized using consistent hashing. This
    ensures that the same original identifier always maps to the same pseudonym, allowing for consistent analyses
    without exposing sensitive information.
</p>

<h2>3a. Typing distances</h2>

<p>
    Pairwise typing distances are computed as a Hamming distance: the number of differing alleles between two
    sequences. Undecoded/missing cells are ignored by default unless the <em>count unknown</em> option is enabled,
    which treats missing values as distinct. A second matrix of sample-date differences (in days) is computed to
    allow temporal filtering in the correlation step, using the Typing Temporal parameter <strong>TT</strong>
    (default: 365 days).
</p>


<h2>3b. Epidemiological distances</h2>

<p>
    For each spatial level (room, ward, clinic), we compute a temporal distance
    between patients' stays. Overlapping stays are stored as positive integers (number of overlapping days); gaps
    between stays are stored as negative integers (days between stays). The Contact Temporal parameter
    <strong>CT</strong>
    (default: -3 days) allows a small gap/lead to account for indirect transmission, and the Contact Spatial
    parameter <strong>CS</strong> (default: "CWR") controls which spatial resolution is used for defining contacts.
